### Browse Files
Accessible uses a special method to read & export files that are usually hiden from the user.

### Open & Extract Internal Apps
Apps that are usually not Accessible on the Home Screen or App Library can now be opened & extracted. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since these apps are on the /Application directory, no user-installed or uninstallable apps will be shown. Do not ask for this as it is not possible.

### Get Deeper Device Information
Accessible can translate MobileGestalt into a user-readable report telling you what tweaks you have enabled from SparseRestore tools like [Nugget](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget).

## How about Apple Watches?
No problem! Extract files from your Apple Watch by path, or directly save MobileGestalt.

## How does it work?
* It's very simple! Accessible uses the `file:///` extension and parses it as a URL with the requested directory attached the end. From this extension, we can return readable files.
    * Example: `file:///Applications` would return all the files found in the `/Applications` directory.
* An app may be able return these files (I haven't tried, and I have no programming knowledge), but I decided to use Shortcuts as it has been the most reliable method.
* On Apple Watches, the `file:///` extension is used as well. However, Apple Watches cannot return folders, so only specific plists can be read unfourtantely. 

## Readable Directories
* /System - Can read almost everything in this directory and contains a lot of important system files.
* /Applications - The most *accessible* directory here. Contains only non user-installed apps (I call them "Internal" apps).
* /var - Here, you can only read `/preboot`. No other files can be read.
